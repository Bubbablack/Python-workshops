    "The rules are -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When <b>getting</b> the value of a variable, Python first looks in the local scope. If it finds it, it will use it. If it does not find it, it will look in the global scope. If it finds it there, it will use it. Otherwise it will raise NameError.\n",
    "2. When <b>setting</b> the value of a variable, Python will always use the local scope, unless the 'global' keyword is used."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "My solution was to place all the values at the top of the module, so that they are in the 'global' scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions that 'return' the values can just return them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function that 'changes' the values used the global keyword, so when called it changes the global values that will be returned next time one of the other functions is called.\n"

    "\n",
    "I explained the difference between positional and keyword arguments earlier. I showed how it is up to the caller of the function to decide whether to use one or the other or a mixture. The main rule is that positional arguments must always appear before keyword arguments in the argument list.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the person who wrote the function wants to ensure that some arguments are called positionally, or that others are called using keywords.  I won't go into the reasons here, as it is unlikely that you will want to do it yourself at this stage. But it is important that you understand the syntax, as you may see it being used in functions that you want to call.\n"
