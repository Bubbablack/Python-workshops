    "The idea behind it is very simple. Most good programmers try to write code that looks aesthetically pleasing. However, different programmers may have different ideas about 'good style'. In a team of programmers, you may find that a number of code alterations are purely cosmetic, and do not change the functionality at all. The problem is that, as far as git is concerned, these are all 'diffs' that have to be reviewed, checked, and committed. This adds an unnecessary burden on the maintainers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could try to come up with your own style guide and insist that everyone follows it. But some people find it easier to 'outsource' this to a 3rd-party tool. This is where Black comes in. It has its own style-guide built in, so when you run it against your code base, it will reformat anything that does not conform. This ensures that all code will conform to the standard, and eliminates a source of spurious 'diffs'.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will surprise some programmers if they are not used to it. The code that they so carefully formatted will look different after the commit. However, they should quickly adapt to this and learn to focus on the code itself, not the way it looks.\n"

    "## Python enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Python's distinctive features is 'dynamic typing'. In many computer languages, before you can use a variable, you have to declare its type (int, str, float, etc). This is known as 'static typing'. Once declared, it is an error to try to assign a value of a different type to it. In Python this restriction does not apply - in the same function you can assign an int to 'x', and then assign a str to 'x'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although powerful, this has a disadvantage. Languages with static typing can detect at compile time if a programmer tries to assign a value of a different type, so errors like this are picked up before running the program. In Python, it <b>might</b> be \n",
    "an error, but there is no way of telling until you actually run the program. In the past, this has been a reason for people to avoid using Python for larger projects.\n",

Instead, the proposal assumes the existence of a separate off-line type checker which users can run over their source code voluntarily. Essentially, such a type checker acts as a very powerful linter. (While it would of course be possible for individual users to employ a similar checker at run time for Design By Contract enforcement or JIT optimization, those tools are not yet as mature.)"
