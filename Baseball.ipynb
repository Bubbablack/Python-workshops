    "## Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two teams - Home and Away\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four 'bases' - player starts from home base, then advances to first base, second base, third base, then back to home base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time a player gets back to home base the team scores one run.\n",
    "\n",
    "9 players on each team\n",
    "\n",
    "9 innings for each team\n",
    "\n",
    "Each innings ends after 3 'outs', then the other team can bat\n",
    "\n",
    "Away team bats first\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement all the rules would be complicated, so here is a simplified subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each ball there are 5 possible results -\n",
    "- single - batter runs to one base\n",
    "- double - batter runs to two bases\n",
    "- triple - batter runs to three bases\n",
    "- homerun - batter runs to all four bases\n",
    "- out - batter is out\n",
    "\n",
    "When the 'batter' has run from the home base, he becomes a 'runner' and waits at the base he has reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runners advance the amount of bases equal to that of the batter's hit (i.e. if the batter hits a double, each runner will advance two bases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time a runner reaches home base, he goes to the back of his team's batting lineup, and the team scores one run.\n",
    "\n",
    "After three 'outs', the innings is finished and the other team starts their innings.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each team has completed 9 innings, the game is over, and the team with the highest number of runs is the winner.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "2 teams, 9 in each team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Must maintain a sequence, as they must bat in turn, and then return to the back when 'out'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a 'list'. Number the players from 1 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "When player goes out to bat, take the first player in the list, remove him, add him to 'field' (see next).\n",

    "\n",
    "2 teams - 2 lists, or list-of-lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "If list-of-lists, subscript between 0 and 1. Use constants - HOME = 0, AWAY = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have global variable 'batting' for team that is batting. On change, 'batting = not batting' to switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Field\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 bases - home, first, second, and third.\n",
    "\n",
    "A player at home base is a 'batter'. A player at any other base is a 'runner'.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will always be a batter at home base. The other bases could have a runner, or be empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each play the players will progress along the bases, unless the batter is out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Represent the field with a list of [None, None, None, None], where None means empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores can be 1-4, or 'out'. Use zero for out, so score can be in range 0-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use random.randint to generate score in that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "[TODO] add weightings, so that 1's are scored more often than 4's etc.\n",
