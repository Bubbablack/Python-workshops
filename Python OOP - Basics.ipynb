    "## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name implies, OOP is concerned with programming using 'objects'.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "An object can be described as a computer representation of 'something'. This could be something physical, like a person, an animal, an inventory item; or it could be something more abstract, such as a company, a message, a business process.\n",
    "\n",
    "All objects share these characteristics -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They have 'attributes'. A person can have a name, an age, an address. A message can have a subject, a body, a list of recipients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. They have 'behaviours'. A person can eat, sleep, run. A message can be modified, be sent, be deleted.\n",

    "#### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many terms associated with OOP - class, , subclass, superclass, object, instance, attribute, method, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. In most cases it is fairly obvious what is being referred to, but most of the terms have no formal definition, and some of them have identical or very similar meanings to others. This provides scope for misunderstanding between two people usng the same term but with a different meaning. There is no magic answer to this problem, but my advice is 'If in doubt, spell it out'.\n",
    " In other words, in communication, do not assume that the other party shares your understanding of a term, be as specific as possible.\n"

    "\n",
    "Classes and instances are the building blocks of OOP. It can be difficult for novices to grasp the difference, so I will try to explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 'Class' is often referred to as a 'Class Definition'. I think this is a good starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you want to create an object that represents a dog. You have to decide what 'attributes' and 'behaviours' you want to keep track of. The 'Class Definition' is where you specify what attributes and behaviours your Dog will have. However, your Class Definition does not represent any particular dog. To create an actual dog, you have to create an 'instance' of your Dog class. Using the same Class Definition, you can create as many 'dog' instances as you like.\n"

    "Three points to notice here -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By convention in Python, class names use CamelCase, instance names use lower_case_with_underscores.\n",
    "2. To create an instance, you 'call' the class, using brackets after the class name.\n",
    "3. You will see that Python calls the instances a 'Dog object'. The word 'object' here is synonymous with 'instance', and you will hear people using the two terms interchangeably. However, in other contexts 'object' could mean something else, so be aware when communicating with others.\n"
